## Python Installation and Environment Setup

### Choosing the Right Environment
1. **Jupyter Notebook (Beginner Level)**  
   - Interactive web-based interface for code execution.
   - Easy to visualize outputs and plots.
   - Great for data analysis and prototyping.

2. **Google Colab (Intermediate Level)**  
   - Cloud-based Jupyter environment.
   - No installation required, free access to GPUs/TPUs.
   - Good for collaborative work and quick experiments.
   - **Drawbacks of Colab:**  
     - Limited runtime (disconnects after inactivity).
     - Internet dependency.
     - Limited access to system-level configurations.

3. **VS Code (Pro Level)**  
   - Versatile code editor with extensive support for various languages.
   - Supports debugging, version control, and extensions.
   - **Why Choose VS Code Over Colab:**  
     - Full control over local environment.
     - Better for project development and deployment.
     - Works offline.

### Installing VS Code and Python
1. Download and install **Visual Studio Code** from the official website.
2. Install **Python** from the Python.org website.
3. Add required extensions in VS Code:
   - Python
   - Jupyter
   - Pylance (for better code suggestions and linting)

### Understanding IDEs and VS Code
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** Combines code editing, debugging, and testing in one interface.
- **VS Code:** A lightweight code editor with powerful extensions making it function like a full-fledged IDE.

## Python File Types
- **.py:** Standard Python script file, used for writing code that can be executed.
- **.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook format, supports both code and markdown explanations.

## Basic Python Concepts

### Mathematical Expressions
Start with basic arithmetic operations such as:
```python
print(2 + 3)
print(5 * 4)
print(10 / 2)
print(2 ** 3)  # Exponentiation
```

### Variables: Storing Data in Memory
Variables are used to store values for future reference. Example:
```python
a = "sanju"  # String type variable
b = 10       # Integer type variable
c = 3.14     # Float type variable
```

### Functions: Input and Output
A function takes an input, processes it, and returns an output. Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
print(greet("Sanju"))
```

## Python Data Types
1. **String (`str`)** - Sequence of characters, e.g. `"hello"`
2. **Boolean (`bool`)** - True/False values, e.g. `True`, `False`
3. **Integer (`int`)** - Whole numbers, e.g. `10`, `-5`
4. **Float (`float`)** - Decimal numbers, e.g. `3.14`, `-0.01`
5. **Imaginary (`complex`)** - Numbers with imaginary components, e.g. `3 + 4j`

## Overview of Data Structures

### List
- Ordered, mutable collection of items.
- Example:
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", 4.5]
  ```

### Tuple
- Ordered, immutable collection of items.
- Example:
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "banana")
  ```

### Dictionary
- Key-value pairs, unordered.
- Example:
  ```python
  my_dict = {"name": "Sanju", "age": 25}
  ```

### Set
- Unordered collection of unique items.
- Example:
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
  ```
